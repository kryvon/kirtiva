## 🌸 About Me

Hi, I’m **Kirti** 👩‍💻

<!-- intro section -->

A developer in the making, curious explorer, and someone who believes every line of code is a step closer to a dream.  
Currently diving deep into **C++**, **Java**, and **Web Development** — but this is just the beginning.

## 🚀 Future Plans

<!-- my vision -->

- 🌍 Contribute to **open-source communities** and give back to the coding world.
- 🏗️ Build **real-world, large-scale projects** that solve meaningful problems.
- 🎯 Prepare myself to work with **Microsoft, Amazon, and Google** — not just as an engineer, but as a creator of impact.
